# Work-Day-Scheduler

Purpose: The purpose of the assigment was to create a work day scheduler 

Description: I created a work day schedule that allowed you to freely change any events you entered in a specifc time block, log your current, past or future events, save the events, so that you can mange your time effectively. It also logged the time of day it was when looking at the planenr useing local storage on your computer or device. Each block is time coded to a specific color depending on whether the events were current, in the past or the future, along with the date, time of day and a small description of what the calendar is. When you refresh the page AFTER saving the event you logged is still there, you can also simply just eraset the eveny by clicking on it, deleting it using the backspace button and then save it. It's sinmple, and easy to use!![Screenshot (271)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107810359/205518161-7a7a9bec-d10b-4b3a-bf1f-61124cee40b0.png)
